Description: Performs Bayesian estimation for survey data using the finite
    population Bayesian bootstrap (FPBB) and Bayesian additive regression trees 
    (BART). It is primarily intended for use with nonprobability survey samples.
    Estimates from a survey sample are adjusted to match a reference sample that 
    is assumed to be representative of the target population. Can perform 
    inference using Bayesian propensity score weighting, superpopulation
    prediction modeling, and doubly-robust inference using both propensity and 
    prediction models.
